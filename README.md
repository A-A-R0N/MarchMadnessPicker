Randomly selects a winner based on projected odds.

I know nothing about college basketball. Every year I look at projections for each round on http://fivethirtyeight.com/20XX-march-madness-predictions/ and roll dice against the odds of each matchup. This year I cannot find my dice and so I wrote a quick script to calculate the winnner. I run it out of the command prompt so I can rerun it quickly.
